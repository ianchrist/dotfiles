## Introduction
The following are various configuration files used on my Arch Linux system. This is intended mainly as a backup, but it can also be used to help others when writing their configuration files for various pieces of software. The following repository starts in the home directory. This means that if you are viewing this repositories base directory, the files you see would go in the /home/$USER/ directory. Below are the files listed,where I will be going through all of the files in the base directory, and then start going deeper in the various directories.

# Conclusion
Once again, these are mainly used as a backup for my systems configuration files. If anyone stumbles across these, it may be of benefit to look to these as references or simply to use them. I will add more configuration files as time goes on. In addition, I would also like to include pictures to give an idea as to what these configuration files do or look like.
