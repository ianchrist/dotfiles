Polybar weather script.
This is a simple script to get the weather for Polybar to use. It gets its
information from openweathermap.org and grabs the needed info from the JSON
file that the call provides. An API key must be obtained for this to work,
and a file called credentials.py must also be created. In credentials, you
must simply set the variables city_id, api_key, and units.
